    1. Currently running on WSL (Ubuntu 18.04 LTS) and Xilinx Pynq Image
    2. CMake
        Installed through terminal using the following commands:
            $ wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.16.4/cmake-3.16.4.tar.gz       //download file
            $ tar -zxvf cmake-3.16.4.tar.gz                                                             //extract file
            $ cd cmake-3.16.4                                                                           //cd into extracted file
            ./bootstrap                                                                                 //command to run and install cmake
            $ make                                                                                      //after CMake has bootstrapped
                (Note: might need to run "sudo apt install make" first)
            $ sudo make install                                                                         //install

            $ gcc <file_name> -o <binary_file_name>                                                     //creates a binary file in the same directory based from the textfile
            $ ./binary_file_name                                                                        //executes binary file

            $ sudo apt install python3-pip                                                              //install pip3 package for python3
            $ python3 --version                                                                         //check if successfully installed and what version
            $ pip3 --version                                                                            //check if successfully installed and what version
    5. Python3 Virtual Environment
        Installed through the terminal using the following commands
            $ pip3 install venv                                                                         //install virtual environment
            $ python3 -m venv ./fprime-venv                                                             //creates a virtual environment called fprime-venv
    6. Installing F-Prime
        Installed through the terminal using the following commands within the virtual environment
            $ git clone https://github.com/nasa/fprime

Setting Up F-Prime: The following was based on NASA F'Prime install.md found on their GitHub
    1. Launch the fprime virtual env first
            $ . ./fprime-venv/bin/activate
        Note: 
            After creating the virtual environment, you don't need to create it again)
            You can just run the above command line to activate the virtual environment
            Use "deactivate" if you want to leave the virtual environment
    2. Installing F-Prime
        Installed through the terminal using the following commands within the virtual environment
            $ git clone https://github.com/nasa/fprime
    3. Installing F' Python Packages
            cd <path/to/fprime/checkout>
            pip install ./Fw/Python
            pip install ./Gds
        Note:
            These commands are run within the virtual env
            If pip does not work, try using pip3
            These commands may take a while to run and appear to be hanging, I personally left it running for a couple of hours before everything finished
    4. Checking F-Prime Installation
            cd Ref                                                                                      //located in Fprime folder
            fprime-util generate
            fprime-util build --jobs 32
            fprime-util install --jobs 32


Getting Started with F': The following is based on NASA F' Tutorial.md on their GitHub
    1. Generate the Ref Application
            cd fprime/Ref
            fprime-util generate
    2. Generate the F' Framework
            cd fprime
            fprime-util generate
    3. Build SignalGen Component
            cd fprime/Ref/SignalGen
            fprime-util build
    4. Build Ref Deployment
            cd fprime/Ref
            fprime-util build
    5. Install the Ref Deployment
            cd fprime/Ref
            fprime-util install
    6. Generating Implementation Stubs of SignalGen
            cd fprime/Ref/SignalGen
            fprime-util impl
            fprime-util impl-ut
    7. Building Unit Test of SignalGen
            cd fprime/Ref/SignalGen
            fprime-util build-ut
            fprime-util check                                                                          //this should display the output of the unit test

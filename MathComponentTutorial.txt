This following guide was written based on NASA Math Component tutorial found on their Github

2.1.1 MathOpPort
    - create a directory called MathPorts in the /Ref directory
        cd fprime/Ref
        mkdir MathPorts
    - create a XML file in the /MathPorts directory and follow the code on NASA github
        vim MathOpPortAi.xml
    - create a CMake file in the /MathPorts directory according to NASA tutorial guide
        vim CMakeLists.txt
    - modify the CMake file in the /Ref directory according to NASA tutorial guide
        cd fprime/Refd
        vim CMakeLists.txt
    - when done, due to a bug you must purge in the /Ref directory and regenerate before building
        cd fprime/Ref
        fprime-util purge
        cd fprime 
        fprime-util generate
        cd fprime/Ref
        fprime-util generate
        cd fprime/MathPorts
        fprime-util build


- need to run "fprime-util build" in the following directory:
    MathPorts
    Ref
    MathSender

- unit test done in MathSender directory
- follow instructions

- create main.cpp under test/ut with code from github
- modify tester.hpp file (code on github)
- modify tester.cpp file (code on github)
-  you gotta rebuild fprime/ref every time you do the implementaiton stubs
    purge in ref
    gen in fprime then ref
    build mathports, ref, mathsender,
    build-ut in mathsender


- fprime-gds -d fprime/Ref                          //run this command under /fprime directory in the virtual env

Scripts for BenchMarking
    cd /fprime
    vim CPUBenchmark.sh
        #!/bin/bash
        #Script to run and output CPU utilziation

        echo "Starting CPU Bench Mark"
        sar 1 30 >> CPU.out
        echo "CPU Bench Mark Done"
        #end
    vim Benchmark.sh
        #!/bin/bash
        CPU="bash CPUBenchmark.sh"

        $CPU &

        fprime-gds -d ./Ref
        #end
    chmod u+x CPUBenchmark.sh
    chmod u+x Benchmark.sh
    ./Benchmark.sh                                   //run this command to run the Python script
